# Web Development - Lesson 5
### GIS Services

## Resources
* [Leaflet documentation](https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html)
* [Esri-Leaflet plugin](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/)
* [ArcGIS Javascript API webmap documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/webmap-basic/index.html)

## Task
You will be publishing a service through ArcGIS Online, and then pulling it in as a layer into a web map.
1. Take a look through the examples in this repository. Pay close attention to the different *services* and *layers* they use.
2. Work through the tutorial in the *Fu* textbook, chapter 5 on publishing layers in ArcGIS Online (make sure you read through the introduction, starting on page 177, first).
  * [Here is a link to the data you will need for this tutorial](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qh5gX8j5pToStkjU_CtVRYHAfAt5KF5-)
3. Then visit the [MN Geospatial Commons](https://gisdata.mn.gov). Search for and download a dataset of your choice.
4. Load the dataset into ArcPro and publish it to ArcGIS Online
  * What type of layer (feature layer, image tile layer, or vector tile layer) you publish it as is up to you.
5. Create a web map (using one of the examples in this repository) that displays your layer on the map.
6. Push the code for your completed web map up to Github.

## Deliverable
After you are done:
 * Post a link to your forked repository on Canvas.
